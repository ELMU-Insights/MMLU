# ðŸ”’ Law Enforcement MMLU Dataset

Welcome to the official repository of the **Law Enforcement Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)** dataset. This open-source initiative aims to benchmark large language models (LLMs) and human performance across a wide array of enforcement domains including criminal law, investigative procedures, digital forensics, and ethical enforcement conduct.

---

## ðŸŒŽ Purpose

To provide a high-quality, peer-reviewed benchmark to evaluate reasoning, recall, and decision-making abilities of both AI systems and professionals within the law enforcement ecosystem. This dataset will also be used to compare the performance of different LLMs â€” including our proprietary system, ELMU Insights.Akta.
